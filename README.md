# Health Care Service

The Healthcare Web App is a React-based application that allows users to manage healthcare services. Users can add, edit, and remove services, and the data persists in localStorage to retain services across browser sessions.


## Features

 - Add Healthcare Services: Users can add new healthcare services with a name, description, and price.
 - Edit Healthcare Services: Users can edit existing services.
 - Delete Healthcare Services: Users can remove services they no longer need.
 - LocalStorage Integration: Services persist across page reloads using localStorage.
 - Responsive Design: The app uses Tailwind CSS to ensure a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.



## Tech Stack

 - React: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 - Redux Toolkit: State management library used to manage the application's services.
 - Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
 - LocalStorage: For persisting services data across sessions.
